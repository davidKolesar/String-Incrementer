# String-Incrementer
This is a programming exercise which identifies numbers at the end of a String and increments them.

# Rules:

If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.
If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.

Examples:

foo -> foo1

foobar23 -> foobar24

foo0042 -> foo0043

foo9 -> foo10

foo099 -> foo100

Attention: If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.
